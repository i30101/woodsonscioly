Another school year has passed, indicating the end of another Science Olympiad season.

# Performance Review
The 2023-2024 Science Olympiad season was WSO's best so far. Our team earned a total of 3 trophies and 72 medals, a considerable feat and a testament to the dedication and hard work of our members. Our competitions this year were:

- Georgia Scrimmage(4th): 5 medals
- Fairfax Invitational (2nd): 13 medals
- Princeton Invitational (8th): 7 medals
- Fairfax Regional (1st): 32 medals
- Virginia States Tournament (4th): 15 medals

# Rising Above Struggles
The successes of WSO this season were achieved despite a number of significant setbacks. Fairfax County canceled extracurricular activities on January 6th, the day of the Fairfax Invitational, despite the following day having now snow. We canceled the Carnegie Mellon two days before we left due to the incoming snowstorm. And on February 2nd, the States and Regionals teams had to compete simultaneously at the Princeton Invitational and the rescheduled Fairfax Invitationals. However, due to the hard work of all teams, we ranked 8th at Princeton and won the 2nd place trophy at Fairfax.

# Season in Review: President's Remarks
Now that the season has come to a close, I would like to thank everyone on the Science Olympiad team this year for their remarkable dedication and hard work. Our students, for working on their notes and builds despite two cancelled competitions. Our officers, for serving their club on top of their difficult events. And Mrs. Babcock, for her ever-present passion and wisdom.

And of course, I would like to thank our caring and supportive parents. Your commitment as volunteers, chauffeurs, and chaperones is a face of WSO that always deserves more appreciation. I thank you all for providing your children with so many resources that allowed us to succeed, and understanding the cancellations that must have been a logistical nightmare to all households.

As the departing Vice President and the incoming President, I have to say that I certainly learned a lot this season. I will share those lessons with my officers, States members, and everyone else on the team to make the 2024-2025 season even better than the least. I look forward to a season filled with trophies, medals, and cheers!
