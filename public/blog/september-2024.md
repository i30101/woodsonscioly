First, we want to thank you all for attending our interest meeting on Wednesday, September 4th. We hope you found it informative, and we hope you had some fun too! If you were unable to attend, not to worry! All of the information shared at the interest meeting will be included in this message.

# Upcoming Dates
This week, we will be holding prep sessions to help students get ready for tryouts and to answer any questions, so feel free to join us in Mrs. Babcock's room, A140, after school on **September 11th and 12th**! Tryouts testing will be on **September 18th and 19th in Cavalier Hall**; students may choose what event tests they will be taking in each block and should come prepared with the materials they need for those tests. The tryouts sign up Google Form can be found [here](https://forms.gle/o5fifLjPfiAJ3eCQ9). Supplies such as pencils, field guides, and calculators will not be provided for students who fail to bring their own.

# Tryouts Guide
Our officers have written up guidelines, clarifications, and test expectations in the [2024-2025 Tryouts Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19y7ZXFXfjoNXjuedQgDqIaNd71Adz4r87anZi_SUbeI/edit?usp=sharing). Tryouts tests may not necessarily follow the official Science Olympiad guidelines for this season, so please refer to your specific event's guidelines to prepare. Students planning on trying out for build events should refer to the modified [Electric Vehicle guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yf9HwpVG-B8nPU1wzOUWPqes9EywRjVg8FlBEfkbyLI/edit?usp=sharing); this will be the tryouts process for all builders regardless of event.

# Build Update
The following are clarifications for build tryouts this year. If you have any questions regarding build tryouts, please reach out to the officers.

- You may use capacitors
- You can only use the motors provided
- You may not use any ICs or PCBs (or any component containing these) for the purpose of power regulation (voltage conversion, current regulation, etc)
- The vehicle must be powered solely by the two AA batteries
- No two points on the vehicle may have a electric potential of more than 3V
