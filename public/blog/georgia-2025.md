Great job to all WSO competitors! Since the 2022-2023 season, Woodson Science Olympiad has competed in the annual Georgia Scrimmage, a virtual invitational run by Georgia Science Olympiad. Drawing teams from across the nation, the Georgia Scrimmage is one of the earliest competitions and provides experience for study events.

For this year's Georgia Scrimmage, Woodson Science Olympiad competitors took tests across a three-day period, from Tuesday, November 15th to Thursday, November 17th. During these days, Mrs. Babcock was crowded with exam takers for hours after school, showing the dedication of our members.

# Performance Review
Woodson Science Olympiad had a strong start to its 2024-2025 season at the Georgia Scrimmage. Pitted against 88 other Division C teams, team Godzilla prevailed, ranking 2nd. This meant Woodson beat 2 other schools that attended the 2023-2024 Nationals Tournament, Marquette University High School and the Fulton Science Academy. Teams Rodan and Mothra ranked 25th and 35th, respectively, a strong showing for the Regionals teams. Individual event medals were as follows:

Build Captain Matthew Lee shared his positive thoughts on the tournament's results. Given how early it is in the season, Lee believed "the studies did really great" and the team had "really exceeded expectations." In regards to Lee's personal event rankings, this Georgia Scrimmage "was my best yet." Looking ahead, Lee said "Our strong team performance gives me an optimistic outlook for the rest of the season."

The Georgia Scrimmage was one of six competitions planned for the 2024-2025 season. Our next and last virtual invitational, hosted by Monta Vista High School, will be in mid-November. Happy studying and building!
