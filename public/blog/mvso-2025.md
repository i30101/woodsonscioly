This was Woodson Science Olympiad's first year competing at the Monta Vista Invitational. Despite being early in the season, we were determined to give our builds a chance to prepare before in-person competitions later in the season.

# Performance Review
Once again, Woodson stood strong against other nationally-competitive teams, ranking 4th. Most notable was team Godzilla's first place medal in Helicopter, a strong start to an event category that was difficult in previous seasons. However, some difficulties with builds were evident, with Robot Tour placing below expectations (4th) and Electric Vehicle receiving a disqualification. Despite these mishaps, we will continue to prepare for strong performances at other invitationals.
