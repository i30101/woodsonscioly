This was the inaugural competition of the Flint Hill Invitational, and Woodson's first time competing in a fall in-person invitational for many years.

# Performance Review
Woodson greatly exceeded expectations at the Flint Hill Invitational, ranking 1st above Langley and Lake Braddock's teams. Also notable was the number of medals earned; 29 in total, with 12 of them being 1st place medals.

Once again, we would like to thank Mrs. Babcock, parents, event supervisors, and anyone involved in facilitating our amazing performance at Flint Hill. Our incredible placings would not have been possible without you all!
