At this moment, we have already created our team for the 2024-2025 season and will not accept additional applicants. However, we highly encourage you to try out next year! Tryouts materials for this current season are still available if you wish to get a head start with preparing.</p>
                <h1>Tryouts Checklist</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/9r478SqCtdAfuWBr7">Interest Form</a> - we'll be sending updates, tryouts prep session dates, resources, and more via email. Join our Schoology group too - the code is WK53-XPN3-TJ2PW.</li>
                    <li>Choose your events - check out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19y7ZXFXfjoNXjuedQgDqIaNd71Adz4r87anZi_SUbeI/edit?usp=sharing">Tryouts Guide</a> to see which ones you can try out for. Once you have an idea of what you like, let us know you're trying out by completing the <a href="https://forms.gle/FR6nDqao4jT6TMvX9">Tryouts Signup Form</a>.</li>
                    <li>Builders should look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yf9HwpVG-B8nPU1wzOUWPqes9EywRjVg8FlBEfkbyLI/edit?usp=sharing">build tryouts rules manual</a> to see the requirements for the build portion, which is to create an Electric Vehicle. We highly recommend that all builders bring a build beforehand to test at tryouts. If you want parts for the build exam, please indicate so on the Tryouts Signup form before coming to Mrs. Babcock's room (A140) to pick up parts.</li>
                    <li>Study and practice for your events! The Tryouts Guide has a list of guidelines for each event, so you can find a list of topics that may be covered by each test. Using the scioly.org pages above, the scioly.org test archive, the Rulebook, and anything else you can find, prepare for the tests you will be taking.</li>
                    <li>Go to tryouts! Be confident, get a good night's sleep, and best of luck!</li>

If you want resources for studying, check out <a href="https://scioly.org/">scioly.org</a> for descriptions of the events, event forums, and a text exchange. If you want to take practice tests for events that weren't switched out, definitely go to the scioly.org <a href="https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/Test_Exchange_Archive">Event Archive</a>. However, your definitive resource will be our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19y7ZXFXfjoNXjuedQgDqIaNd71Adz4r87anZi_SUbeI/edit?usp=sharing">Tryouts Guide</a> - it has all the event descriptions, resources, tryouts procedures, and more, all in the same place. Also, we recommend going to our three Tryouts Prep Sessions for additional guidance.</p>
